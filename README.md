# Smallest-Path
Program that finds the smallest path when combining any element of the first row in the matrix with any element of the last row. Sum of items is minimized.
When the matrix is drawn in the usual way, the path goes absolutely down. It's legal to switch from each cell directly to one of the three cells below it.

# Algorithm
1-) First, I created a matrix generated numbers between 0-9 randomly.

2-) I found the sum of the numbers while going down the matrix. (Cell Weight - Path Weight)

3-) I found the smallest sum value in the bottom row.

4-) I found the smallest sum path.

5-) Finally, I printed the numbers on the screen.
